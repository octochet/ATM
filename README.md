# CASE STUDY 2 : ATM

###### Made by : Chetan Moturi (CS21B017)

This project is made entirely on java and utilizes the 
various object oriented programming concepts we have learned 
until now.

This project aims to imitate the working of an ATM 
as much as possible. 

The ATM consists of funcionalities like withdrawal, 
deposit and changing pin.

It also includes use of access specifiers for security of 
information.
